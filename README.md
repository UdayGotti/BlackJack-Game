# 🃠 Blackjack Game

A simple and interactive Blackjack game built using Python.
This project simulates the classic casino card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while competing against the dealer.

## 🎮 About the Game

Blackjack is a popular card game played between the player and the dealer.
The rules are simple:

- Each player is dealt two cards.
- Number cards = their value
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) = 10
- Ace = 1 or 11 (whichever benefits the player)

### Player Options:
- **Hit** → draw another card
- **Stand** → stop drawing cards

### Dealer Rules:
- The dealer must continue drawing cards until reaching at least 17.
- Whoever is closer to 21 without going over wins.

This project implements these rules and allows the user to play from the terminal.
